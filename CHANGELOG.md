### Currency conversion API workarounds

We are using an external API for currency conversion.  This API recently
started requiring an API key, and this broke I Hate Money in many ways.

This release adds a set of workarounds for this issue.  This should restore
basic functionality such as adding bills.  However, we had to disable
some operations to prevent crashing:

- Setting or changing the default currency on an existing project is no longer possible.
  However, setting a project to "No currency" is still possible.
- Adding or editing a bill with a currency that differs from the default currency
  of the project is no longer possible

[Longer-term solutions are being discussed](https://github.com/spiral-project/ihatemoney/issues/1232).
If you are using currencies in your projects, your input is welcome.
